The HTML and CSS is taken straight from the lesson as our duty here was just practice the javascript part. (bootstrap CSS)

The goals for the lesson:
    1. Be able to add element as we submit via submit form
    2. Be able to remove element by clicking the delete button
    3. Be able to filter results
